# How to Play

Set Up the Game:

The game is played on a grid board, where each player has their own fleet of ships hidden from their opponent.
The grid is labeled with letters for rows (A to H) and numbers for columns (0 to 7).

Taking Turns:

Players take turns making guesses by selecting a target on their opponent's board.
Guesses are made by entering a row letter (A to H) and a column number (0 to 7).

Guessing and Results:

After making a guess, the result is revealed:
If the guess hits an opponent's ship, the hit is marked with an "*".
If the guess misses all ships, the miss is marked with an "X".

Winning the Game:

The game continues until one of the following conditions is met:
A player sinks all of their opponent's ships first.
Both players have taken a maximum of 20 turns.

Determining the Winner:

If a player sinks all of their opponent's ships, they win the game.
If 20 turns are completed and no player has won, the player with the higher score wins.
Scores are based on the number of hits on the opponent's ships.

Playing Again:

After the game ends, players can reset the boards and start a new game.
The excitement of each game lies in the strategic choices and the thrill of the unknown.
